# 👋 Hi there, I'm Justin

I am a programmer that mainly uses [`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), however I can program in many other programming languages. Currently, I'm working on both frontend and backend web development projects with [`React`](https://reactjs.org/), [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/), and [`Nest`](https://nestjs.com/).

## 📚 Skills

As a web developer, I mainly work with [`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). However I've also worked with [`Spring Boot`](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), a [`Java`](https://www.java.com/en/) framework, [`Python`](https://www.python.org/), [`C#`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [`Go`](https://golang.org/), and of course HTML and CSS for basic frontend development. I taught myself everything I know and can pick up new languages or frameworks pretty quickly. 

More of my projects on [`my repositories`](https://github.com/jtsshieh?tab=repositories) on GitHub.
