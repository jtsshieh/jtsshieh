# 👋 Hi there, I'm Justin

I am a programmer that mainly uses [`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), however I can program in many other programming languages. Currently, I'm working on both frontend and backend web development projects with [`React`](https://reactjs.org/), [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/), and [`Nest`](https://nestjs.com/).

## 📚 Skills

As a web developer, I mainly work with [`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). However I've also worked with [`Spring Boot`](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), a [`Java`](https://www.java.com/en/) framework, [`Python`](https://www.python.org/), [`C#`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [`Go`](https://golang.org/), and of course HTML and CSS for basic frontend development. I taught myself everything I know and can pick up new languages or frameworks pretty quickly. 

## 💻 Current Projects

Here are the some of the projects that I am contributing to:

* 🐦[`Librebird`](https://gitlab.com/rubellite/librebird) - a fully featured mail server with a web app.
  * I am a Co-founder of [Librebird](https://librebird.xyz). along with [@Hiroyuki](https://github.com/WeebHiroyuki).

* 🚢 [`Ship-Dock`](https://github.com/jtsshieh/ship-dock) - a web app for interacting with docker.
